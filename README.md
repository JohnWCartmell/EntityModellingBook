# entitymodellingbook
Source of my online book www.entitymodelling.org. 

The source is represented in xml described by a [document model](https://github.com/JohnWCartmell/documentmodel) and transformed by xslt into html/svg.
The document model is implemented in [ERScript](https://github.com/JohnWCartmell/ERScript).
