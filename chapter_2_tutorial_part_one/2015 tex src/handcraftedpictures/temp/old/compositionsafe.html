               <p> When the parts of a whole have a particular order amongst them then an 'S' shaped
                  symbol (S for sequence) maybe added to the relationship. 
                  In this way we can represent a sentence as a sequence of words: (a)
                  <img src="../../svg/sentenceWord.svg" class="inline">
                  and a word as a sequence of letters: (b)

               <p> Famously, we can represent a DNA molecule (a chromosome?)  as a sequence of nucleotides.

               <br><h2>Levels of Decomposition</h2>
               
               
               <p> When a whole is decomposed into parts then very often we find that the part types
                  can be decomposed further. 
                  We have seen this already: `sentence's can be broken down into `word's and `word's
                  into `letter's. 
                  We then put these together on the diagram the relationships are shown stacked up as
                  follows:
                  
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  <div style="margin:auto; width:1.4720000000000002cm"><img src="../../svg/sentenceWordLetter.svg"></div>
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> The decomposition of wholes into parts can continue over many levels. Thus some linguists,
                  for example, speak of five levels of decomposition of a sentence. These are shown
                  in figure \ref{sentenceFiveLevels}. For another example
                  in a dictionary you see each word with its different senses defined and so a dictionary
                  is composed of words and these, within the context of a dictionary, 
                  are composed of a number of senses\footnote{ For the word `sense' itself we find 
                  no less than ten distinct senses given in the Concise Oxford Dictionary. 
                  The 7th sense and the one we intend for it here is this:
                  
                  <div class="quotation">
                     sense n... 7. meaning, way in which a word etc. is to be understood, intelligibility
                     or coherence or possession of a meaning
                     
                  </div>
                  }, see figure \ref{dictionaryWordSense} for the three levels of a dictionary. 
                  Figure \ref{atom} shows the parts of an atom as understood circa 1930.

                  When the type of a part is identical to the type of the whole then the relationship
                  must be looped around to renter the top after leaving the bottom:

               The implied infinity in this model is a concern which is elaborated by Jonathon Swift
               in rhyme wherein the type in question is the type `flea':

               <p>
                  The front and rear wheels of a bicycle are parts which play different roles within
                  the whole - arguably 
                  the front and back wheels should be modelled as different types of entity for the
                  rear wheel has a 
                  sprocket, or at least a housing for one, whilst the front does not. In the case of
                  a child's scooter though 
                  or in the case, prior to pedal power, of the velocipede, the whole thing has two identical
                  parts playing 
                  different roles within the whole. It is for reasons like this that the role played
                  by a part in a whole 
                  may be specified in a model. The role played is described as an annotation on the
                  composition relationship 
                  at the `whole' end of the relationship.

                  subject noun phrase 
                  and it may have have an object noun phrase. Like the front wheel and the rear wheel
                  
                  of a child's scooter 
                  the subject and object noun phrases are in and by themselves indistinguishable.

               <p>
                  The entirety of a modelling situation is represented by a half box at the upper edge
                  of a diagram.
                  Types whose entities may be free standing - not parts of or dependent on other entities
                  are shown to be 
                  part of the entirety - which, relative to the situation, is the whole of everything.
                  
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> The entirety is the `absolute' whole. It is a principle of logic that when we model
                  we model a 
                  specific situation and this establishes an absolute.
                  Fiction operates the same way as logic in this regard. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> If the modelling situation is that of a single computer the entirety has 
                  cpu, drives and memory as parts as shown in figure \ref{singleComputerModel}.

               \vspace{.2cm}
               
               <p> but if the entirety of the modelling situation is a network of computers then the
                  whole has computers as parts which in turn each have drives and memory
                  as shown in figure \ref{networkComputerModel}.
                  
                  \erboxedFigPicture{networkComputerModel}{h}{Model of a network of computers}

               <p> 
                  Similarly, the terms `true' and `false' are not relative terms - they do not rely
                  on context for their  interpretation - therefore they are absolutes and can be represented
                  in relationship to the absolute.  
                  We will follow the computer science convention of representing them as being of 
                  type `boolean' which in  common language might be translated as the made up word `truthliness'.
                  
                  This leads to the model shown in 
                  figure \ref{boolean2} which depicts true and false as absolutes and as entities of
                  type `boolean'. 
                  Note that from this model we are able to infer the only boolean entities are either
                  the absolute `true' or  the absolute `false'. 
                  
               </p>

               <p> We might not have said this already: an entity model defines the rules 
                  by which entities of any of its types may exist; they do so by declaring the context
                  
                  for their existence i.e. other types of entities and the relationships in which they
                  must 
                  be with these entities in order to exist. The uppermost model in figure \ref{sentenceNounPhrase}
                  
                  declares then that every noun phrase is either subject or object of a sentence
                  \footnote{though 
                  the model states this please be aware that the model might be misguided! Also, later,
                  we 
                  shall we come back to many ambiguities with terms like `word', and likewise is true
                  for the 
                  terms `noun' and `noun phase'.}. Similarly, from the model in figure \ref{boolean2}
                  we are able to 
                  infer that the only boolean entities are either the absolute `true' or the absolute
                  `false'.

               <br><h2>Use of Generalisations</h2>
               
               <p>
                  We gave the example in figure \ref{nucleusProtonNeutron} of an atomic nucleus being
                  composed of many protons and neutrons.
                  This can be expressed slightly differently using the generalisation `nucleon' of the
                  individual terms `proton' and `neutron'
                  by stating: an atomic nucleus is composed of one or more nucleons; every nucleon is
                  either a proton or a neutron;
                  (it's pretty much expressed this way in a diagram from the physicist Harald Fritzsch's
                  book - is it?). 
                  In an entity model diagram the generalisation type 
                  is shown as a box containing the specific types; so figure \ref{nucleusProtonNeutron}
                  may be expressed thus:
                  
                  \begin{center}
                  \input{\erpictureFolder /nucleusNucleon}
                  .
                  \end{center}
                  Be aware that there is a minor difference between this way of expressing the situation
                  and the form in figure \ref{nucleusProtonNeutron}: this way, 
                  is consistent with a nucleus with one neutron and zero protons - in physics this cannot
                  happen.
                  Equally neither representation expresses that the number of protons must equal the
                  number of electrons. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> The same generalisation can be used to express that protons and neutrons are combinations
                  of quarks:

               <p> The reason for the inclusion of a type `adverbial phrase' is illustrated by the example
                  <em>very fiercely barking</em> in which the 
                  degree word `very' is understood as qualifying the word `fiercely' which as a combination
                  (an entity) `very fiercely' then qualifies the word `barking'.
                  The phrase `very fiercely' is an example of an `adverbial phrase' as represented in
                  the model in figure \ref{brintonAdjectivalPhrase}.

               <p>
                  When Gilbert Ryle introduced the phrase `category mistake' he gave a number of examples.
                  
                  The first example is of a visitor to Oxford. The visitor, upon viewing the colleges
                  and library, reportedly inquired "But where is the University?". 
                  The visitor's mistake, explains Ryle, is presuming that a University is 
                  part of the category ``units of physical infrastructure" or some such thing, 
                  rather than the category ``institutions", say, which are far more abstract and complex
                  
                  conglomerations of buildings, people, procedures, and so on.

               <p> Ryle's second example is of a child witnessing the march-past of a division of soldiers.
                  
                  After having had battalions, batteries, squadrons, etc. pointed out, the child asks
                  when is the division going to appear.
                  `The march-past was not a parade of battalions, batteries, squadrons and a division;
                  it was a parade of the battalions,

               <br><h2>Linguistics: Modelling Sentence Structure</h2>
               \label{modellingSentenceStructure}
               
               
               <p> In this section we give an extended example of entity modelling by demonstrating
                  the modelling of English sentence structure. 
                  Our starting point has been the syntactic rules presented in chapters x-z of the book
                  of Brinton: <em>The Structure of Modern English</em>\footnote{Brinton, 2000}.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> In the study of syntax, linguists seek to understand and express the rules by which
                  some sequences of words can be comprehended as having a structure which is well-formed
                  - that is, we find them  grammatical - and some do not. In earlier sections we have
                  spoken about an entity model as representing a theory of what is; we illustrate this
                  now for, as Noam Chomsky wrote in 1957,
                  <em>a grammar of the language L is a theory of L</em>\footnote{Syntactic Structures, N. Chomsky, 1957 (page 49)}. 
                  Chomsky says that each grammar is simply a description of a certain set of utterances,
                  namely those that it generates and he illustrates
                  with reference to a part of chemical theory concerned with structurally possible compounds.
                  
                  Such a theory, says Chomsky, might be said to generate all physically possible compounds
                  just as a grammar generates all 
                  grammatically `possible' utterances\footnote{Syntactic Structures(page 48)}\footnote
                  {Since Chomsky's 1957 descriptions of 
                  phrase structure rules, transformation rules and morphophonemic rules there many different
                  approaches to expressing sentence structure. 
                  The models developed in this section cover the same ground as the phrase structure
                  rules of Chomsky which are expressed as a class of 
                  grammar know as a context free. All context free grammars lead naturally and mechanically
                  to entity models of parse trees. 
                  This section is an illustration of this.}.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> Different authors have described English by various grammatical systems and with
                  varying and over lapping degrees of 
                  success and agreement but each grammar do described is a rule system and what all
                  such rule systems do is to identify and 
                  classify relationships between different parts of grammatical sentences; linguists
                  bring to our attention types of entities 
                  and accompanying composition relationships which otherwise remain hidden. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> 
                  Rule systems invariably focus on different word classes i.e. different types of words
                  such as were introduced in section \ref{typesOfWord}.

               <p>  
                  The type of each word of an example sentence  can be shown by annotating the word
                  entities as follows: 
                  
               </p>

               <p> With regard to the types of words - many words can be used say as nouns and as verbs
                  and so it is the \emph{use} of the word 
                  that is the entity to which a type is assigned.

               <p> Figure \ref{fowlersentenceexample} shows the hierarchically structure of a simple
                  sentence. 
                  It shows the composition relationships between its constituents parts. 
                  Each of the boxes in figure \ref{fowlersentenceexample} is an example of a sentence
                  constituent - a single word or a phrase; 
                  this is a key entity type for the linguist.

               <h3>Sentence Constituents</h3>
               
               
               <p> According to Brinton:
                  
                  <div class="quotation">
                     The study of syntax is the analysis of the constituent parts of a sentence: their
                     form, positioning,
                     and function. Constituents are the proper subparts of sentences. There are different
                     types of constituents classified by the categories which constitute them; these have
                     different
                     functions and internal structures with elements arranged in a specific way. And they
                     may
                     themselves be complex, containing other constituents. The structure of a sentence
                     is hence
                     hierarchical.
                     
                  </div>
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> Brinton notes that not all sequences of words function as constituents. 
                  It is the context, he says,  which determines whether a particular sequence 
                  forms a constituent or not. For example, the sequence of words <em>beautiful flowers</em>
                  is a constituent in <em>I received beautiful flowers for my birthday</em> but not in <em>Though they are beautiful, 
                     flowers cause me to sneeze</em>. The sequence <em>the house on the hill</em> is a constituent in one reading of the ambiguous 
                  sentence <em>I bought the house on the hill</em>, but not in the other; it is a constituent in the sense `I bought the house which
                  is on the hill', 
                  but not in the sense `I bought the house while standing on the hill'.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               
               <p> We can represent sentence constituent as an entity type generalising `phrase' and
                  `word': 
                  
               </p>

                  \ref{examplesofsubjectpredicate};
                  each subject in the table can equally combine with any of the given predicates to
                  form a well-formed sentence. 
                  Though ten sentences are presented by combining different subjects with different
                  predicates we can generate 100 different 
                  sentences\footnote{But only the proviso that some verbs need be inflected to match
                  their subjects - for example `We is for sale' 
                  needs become `We are for sale'.}. What we cannot do is pair any two subjects to produce
                  a well-formed sentence nor any two predicates. This illustrates 
                  that subject phrases and predicate phrases are of distinct types. These are the types
                  `noun phrase' and `verb phrase' respectively. These types of 
                  phrase can appear in other contexts within sentences but for now they appear as subject
                  and predicate respectively.

                  aggregates of which are used to express grammars 
                  technically referred to as context free grammars. This is a formal expression of the
                  fact that a
                  sentence(S) may be constructed as a noun phrase(NP) followed by a verb phrase(VP).

                  What such a rule (\ref{subjectPredicateRule}) does not do is to give a name to the
                  role played by the noun
                  phrase (NP) in the sentence -- that of subject -- and nor does it give a name -- predicate
                  -- to the role played 
                  by the verb phrase (VP). In Entity Modelling we have a notation for just such matters
                  and accordingly we can represent 
                  the subject-predicate rule inclusive of role names by the entity model fragment shown
                  in figure \ref{simpleSentenceSubjectPredicate}.

               <p> The entity type `phrase' of figure \ref{sentenceConstituents2} is very general 
                  - it covers entities such as whole sentences, and the noun phrases and verb phrases
                  shown in the 
                  subject and predicate columns of table \ref{examplesofsubjectpredicate}. Linguists
                  recognise these different phrase types and, 
                  just as for the different types of words, phrases may be substituted in sentences
                  by phrases of like type without 
                  effecting the acceptability of the sentence. Table \ref{tableofphrasetypes} shows
                  some of the major distinctions 
                  within phrase types.

                  composition relationships that are 
                  possible between the different phrase types of a sentence. In this way we use the
                  entity modelling notation as a meta-language in which we describe how different types
                  of sentence constituent can be combined 
                  into grammatical sentences and in so doing present a
                  description of a set of rules for sentence construction. There is not, in linguistic
                  theory, an unequivocal set of rules to 
                  follow  - the rules we choose to model follow close to those presented by Brinton.

               <h3>The grammar of the Verb Phrase</h3>
               
               <p>
                  We have examples of verb phrases in the right hand column of table \ref{examplesofsubjectpredicate}.
                  
                  They are quite varied in their structure. Here is a typical analysis of a verb phrase,
                  in this case for the 
                  predicate of figure \ref{subjectpredicate}:
                  \begin{center}
                  \begin{minipage}{3.6cm}
                  \pspicture(0,-2.5)(3.6,1)
                  %\psgrid
                  \pstree[radius=3pt, levelsep=2cm]
                  {\tagwnode{set a new record}{VP}}
                  {
                  \tagwnode{set}{V}\funl{head}
                  \tagwnode{a new record}{NP}\funr{direct object}
                  }
                  \endpspicture 
                  \end{minipage}
                  \end{center}
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> 
                  Generally, a verb phrase contains a verb which is said to be the head of the phrase.
                  In this example the verb is 
                  complemented by a direct object which is of type `noun phrase'. Note that we can be
                  sure that the phrase `a new record' is of type `noun phrase' 
                  because we can construct a sentence with it as the subject. In fact it can replace
                  any of the subjects in table \ref{examplesofsubjectpredicate}  
                  and new sentences result and, providing that verbs are conjugated appropriately, the
                  results are well-formed though admittedly they are in some 
                  cases very unusual.  
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> According to this analysis the phrase `set a new record' is a verb phrase constructed
                  as a `verb' followed by a `noun phrase' and 
                  this is one general rule of a number of such for the construction of verb phrases.
                  Formally expressed the rule is:
                  
                  
                  
                  \begin{equation}

               <p> In other cases a verb phase consists just of a verb alone and has no constituent
                  noun phrase. Only certain verbs that can be used in this way and these are said to
                  be intransitive. Thus `he cries' is an example in which `he' is the subject and `cries'
                  is a predicate verb phrase consisting solely of the verb.
                  Formally:
                  
               </p>

               <p> The entity model equivalent is simply this:</p>
               
               
               <p> These fragments can be combined like this: </p>

               <p>
                  Still other verb phrases have two obhjects a direct object of the action and an indirect
                  object. Formally:

               <p> This leads to a model combining representations of 
                  rules (\ref{monoTransitiveRule}), (\ref{inTransitiveRule}) and (\ref{diTransitiveRule})like
                  this:

               <p> It is worth saying at this point as an illustration of the choices that are open
                  to an entity modeller in any modelling situation that sometimes the two rules above
                  will be represented together
                  as a single combined rule in which parentheses are used to indicate optionality of
                  the noun phrase: 
                  
               </p>

               <p> Likewise the entity modeller may dispense with the types representing the transitive
                  and intransitive cases and represent the combined situation like this:
                  
                  \begin{center}

                  In total, Brinton describes seven different constructions for verb phrase. These constructions
                  are both summarised and illustrated in table \ref{typesofverbphrase}. Alternatively
                  the rules summarised in table \ref{typesofverbphrase} can be expressed by combining
                  all the different rules into the entity model of a verb phrase shown in figure  
                  \ref{brintonVerbPhrase} in which types `noun phrase', and `prepositional phrase' are
                  yet to be described but `adjectival phrase' was described 
                  earlier in section xxx.

               <h3>The Grammar of the Noun Phrase</h3>
               
               <p> 
                  There are three main types of Noun Phrase and paradoxically two of these types consist
                  of 
                  phrases which are degenerate in the sense that they consist of single words - Pronouns
                  and Proper Names because words of 
                  these types are grammatically acceptable as the subjects of sentences. For simplicity
                  of the modelling we will henceforth 
                  consider pronouns and proper names as types of noun phrase. The other type of noun
                  phrase takes a number of forms but does

               <p> 
                  The final step in constructing a model of a simple sentence is achieved by putting
                  together the models represented in 
                  figures \ref{simpleSentenceSubjectPredicate},\ref{brintonVerbPhrase} and \ref{brintonNounPhraseSpeltOut}
                  and rearranging
                  the diagram to suit. The resulting model is shown in figure \ref{brintonSimpleSentenceStructure}.

               <h3>Marriages and Directed Graphs</h3>
               
               <p> 
                  If we model the marriage entity then we make it double dependent on person entity
                  and 
                  since at the time of writing same sex marriage is not legal in my part of the world
                  I can 
                  model it as a dependent on a male entity on the one hand, and a female on the other:
                  
                  
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  <div style="margin:auto; width:2.6999999999999997cm"><img src="../../svg/maleFemaleMarriage.svg"></div>
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> In this model, unlike in those of figures \ref{sentenceNounPhrase} and \ref{scooter}
                  
                  to which it is superficially similar, the subordinate 
                  entity, `marriage', has no exclusion arc between its dependencies -- which is to say
                  that the model shows each subordinate entity `marriage' to be dependent on two superordinate
                  entities -   those shown as `male' and `female'. For the first time we see that the
                  modelling notation is not constrained to situations where every entity has at most
                  one other that it is dependent on. 
                  It is common practice to describe situations that do have this characteristic as <em>hierarchical</em> - it is the defining principle of
                  hierarchy that in a hierarchical system every entity within the system is subordinate
                  to at most one other entity. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> In other instances of matrix structure the branch types (by which I mean for example
                  the types <em>row</em> and <em>column</em> above) are not 
                  distinct types. We'll see this in the next example - the type in question being <em>arc</em>.  
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> Mathematicians define and use various notions each which abstract the idea of a network
                  of points and connecting lines independently of 
                  how or whether physically realised. 
                  They define such abstract notions using the language of sets and relations;
                  they use the term `graph' for the most abstract concept of such a network and they
                  variously use the terms `point', `node' or `vertex' for the 
                  things connected; generally they use the term `edge', `directed edge', `arc' or `arrow'
                  for the connections. 
                  There is not a single terminology and so we have to plump for one of several available;
                  our definitions will clarify the choices made. 
                  For an entity modeller, and therefore for a database designer, the most straight forward
                  of the graph notions is that of a `directed graph'. 
                  
               </p>

               <h3>Simple Graphs and Identifying Relationships</h3>
               
               <p> One of the restrictions often places on graph structures is that there be at most
                  one edge between any two vertices. 
                  The term `simple graph' is used for graphs having this property and having the further
                  property that vertices are not 
                  linked to themselves. Now the fact that there is at most one edge between any two
                  verticies means that an edge can be uniquely
                  identified by identifying the vertices that it connects. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> The `arc' type as used in models of simple directed graphs is an example of one each
                  whose instances may be uniquely 
                  identified by relationships with other entities. Such relationships in entity modelling
                  terminology are said 
                  to be <em>identifying relationships</em> though this terminology lacks rigour for it is the set of them which 
                  are identifying not the individual relationships. 
                  
               </p>    
               
               
               <p> Identifying relationships are represented with a mark across the relationship having
                  the form of the letter `I'. 
                  Adding these marks to the model of a directed graph we get the model of a simple directed
                  graph: 
                  
                  
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  <div style="margin:auto; width:2.2720000000000002cm"><img src="../../svg/simpleDirectedGraph.svg"></div>
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> The terms <em>network</em> and <em>matrix</em> are commonly used in contrast to the term hierarchical to refer to arrangements of
                  entities not 
                  constrained to be hierarchical; for example in organisational structure the term <em>matrix management</em> is used in
                  situations were different dimensions are managed by different management hierarchies
                  and in which individuals therefore have multiple reporting lines. 
                  The term hierarchical is etymologically derived from Greek <em>sacred ruler</em> and emerged in its modern sense via its use 
                  in medieval times in relation to the church organisation.

               <h3>Matrices and Tabular Displays</h3>
               
               
               <p> In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numeric elements, for example
                  \[ \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
                  
                  <tr>
                     
                     <td>23 </td>
                     <td> 15 </td>
                     <td> 29 </td>
                     
                  </tr>
                  
                  <tr>
                     
                     <td>31 </td>
                     <td> 6 </td>
                     <td> 9  </td>
                     
                  </tr>
                  
                  <tr>
                     
                     <td>-1 </td>
                     <td> 8 </td>
                     <td> 17  </td>
                     
                  </tr>
                  
                  \end{array} \right)\] 
                  
                  
                  <p> is a matrix having 3 rows and 3 columns. Though, as with all matrix structure, 
                     this is essentially 2 dimensional, the content can be communicated linearly either
                     row by row ([23,15,29], [31,6,9] and [-1,8,17]) 
                     or column by column ([23,31,-1],[15,6,8] and [29,9,17]). 
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p> As you see with this example, each element of any matrix is both part of a row and
                     part of a column and so, as with the `marriage' entity, the `element' entity is 
                     modelled as a subordinate to two others of different types as shown in figure \ref{matrix0}.
                     The two ways of communicating the matrix correspond to the two branches of this entity
                     model. The row by row communication is described by this model: 
                  </p>

                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  and the column by column communication by this one:
                  
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  <div style="margin:auto; width:1.9000000000000001cm"><img src="../../svg/matrixColumnHierarchic.svg"></div>

               <p> There is a similar shape to the models representing the structure\footnote{I am distinguishing
                  here between the structure of the
                  tabular display from the structure of the subject entitites} of a rectangular table
                  of data. An example is given in figure \ref{dataTable0}. 
                  In the HTML language, and in other computer markup languages, data tables are communicated
                  row by row rather than column by column.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> In other tabular displays the rows or columns of a table, or both, may be grouped
                  together
                  to represent some grouping of the subjects. The structure then has different branches
                  that are hierarchical and joined at the detail level
                  into the recognisable shape of the 2 dimensional matrix structure. One such is illustrated
                  in figure \ref{dataTable1}.

                  in which nesting of detail represents the hierarchy. XML is a language designed for
                  this purpose.
