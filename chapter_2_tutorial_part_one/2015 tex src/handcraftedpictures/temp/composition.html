               <br><h2>Entities and Their Parts</h2>
               
               
               <p> 
                  An entity model is a system of entity types and relationships and for a reader 
                  of a model the most 
                  important relationships - those to understand first - are those that represent associations
                  between entities 
                  and their parts. These relationships are called 
                  <em>composition relationships</em> and the term <em>composition structure</em> is used to refer to the subsystem 
                  consisting solely of entity types and compositions relationships. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> 
                  In the sections which follow we describe notations for describing the properties of
                  entities and their composition relationships including cardinality and optionality
                  (the crows foot and dashing of lines), 
                  exclusion (the exclusion arc), recursion (looping structures), abstraction (nested
                  boxes), the absolute (diagram root). 
                  Almost all this notation applies equally to more general types of relationship but
                  the approach is to introduce the 
                  notation in this more restricted setting. The notation is as used in the SSADM method
                  as described, 
                  for example, in Richard Barker's book, but with further development including the
                  special treatment of composition relationships, and thereby their foregrounding, 
                  and the notation for the absolute.  
                  
               </p>  
               
               
               <p>
                  Composition relationships are shown top-down, which is to say that they are drawn
                  leaving the lower edge of 
                  the box representing type of the whole and entering the upper edge of the type representing
                  the part, as here: (a)
                  <img src="./svg/wholeOfOneOrMoreParts.svg" class="inline">. This fragment signifies that there are <em>one or more</em> 
                  entities of type <em>part type</em> within the whole. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> Looking at composition relationships the other way around - bottom up - then they
                  are seen to relate 
                  entities with the contexts in which they exist
                  and it is because of this that these are the most important relationships in an entity
                  model - they 
                  provide context to entities. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> The presence of the crows foot is representative of multiplicity - if the crows foot
                  is 
                  present the notation asserts that there may be many parts of type <em>part type</em> within each 
                  entity of type <em>whole type</em>.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> 
                  If the crows foot is absent, as here: (b)
                  <img src="./svg/wholeOfExactlyOnePart.svg" class="inline">
                  then the assertion is that there is <em>exactly one</em> entity of type <em>part type</em> within the whole. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               
               <p> A further distinction is made by use of a half-dashed line to represent the 
                  possibility of zero; this gives us 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> (c) there may be <em>zero, one or more</em> entities of  <em>part type</em> within the whole:
                  <img src="./svg/wholeOfZeroOneOrMoreParts.svg" class="inline">
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  and (d) there may be <em>zero or one</em> entities of type <em>part type</em> :
                  <img src="./svg/wholeOfZeroOrOneParts.svg" class="inline">.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               
               <p> If there are parts of different types, then the structure is shown branching as for
                  example here: (e)
                  <img src="./svg/wholeOfTwoPartTypes.svg" class="inline">
                  or here: (f)
                  <img src="./svg/wholeOfThreePartTypes.svg" class="inline">. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               
               
               <p> Figures 1, 2 and 3 
                  gives basic examples using the notation. 
                  More examples follow as more features of the notation are introduced. 
                  If you find yourself disagreeing with these examples - thinking that what they express
                  
                  is contrary to your understanding then it is reasonable to suppose that I will have
                  achieved 
                  my aim of showing how the notation works - how it can be used to express precise models
                  and that 
                  it is then possible to consider these models, to disagree with them or, better, to
                  
                  refine them.

               <br><h2>Sequential Order</h2>
               
               
               <p> When the parts of a whole have a particular order amongst them then an 'S' shaped
                  symbol (S for sequence) maybe added to the relationship. 
                  In this way we can represent a sentence as a sequence of words: (a)
                  <img src="./svg/sentenceWord.svg" class="inline">
                  and a word as a sequence of letters: (b)

               <p> Famously, we can represent a DNA molecule (a chromosome?)  as a sequence of nucleotides.

               <br><h2>Levels of Decomposition</h2>
               
               
               <p> When a whole is decomposed into parts then very often we find that the part types
                  can be decomposed further. 
                  We have seen this already: `sentence's can be broken down into `word's and `word's
                  into `letter's. 
                  We then put these together on the diagram the relationships are shown stacked up as
                  follows:
                  
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  <div style="margin:auto; width:1.4720000000000002cm"><img src="./svg/sentenceWordLetter.svg"></div>
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> The decomposition of wholes into parts can continue over many levels. Thus some linguists,
                  for example, speak of five levels of decomposition of a sentence. These are shown
                  in figure 4. For another example
                  in a dictionary you see each word with its different senses defined and so a dictionary
                  is composed of words and these, within the context of a dictionary, 
                  are composed of a number of senses\footnote{ For the word `sense' itself we find 
                  no less than ten distinct senses given in the Concise Oxford Dictionary. 
                  The 7th sense and the one we intend for it here is this:
                  
                  <div class="quotation">
                     sense n... 7. meaning, way in which a word etc. is to be understood, intelligibility
                     or coherence or possession of a meaning
                     
                  </div>
                  }, see figure 5 for the three levels of a dictionary. 
                  Figure 6 shows the parts of an atom as understood circa 1930.

               <p>
                  When the type of a part is identical to the type of the whole then the relationship
                  must be looped around to renter the top after leaving the bottom:
                  
                  <img src="./svg/typeRecursive1.svg" class="inline">.
                  
                  
                  This asserts that every <em>type</em> entity is composed of one or more <em>type</em> entities... each one of which, therefore, is itself 
                  composed of one more <em>type</em> entities ... and so on indefinitely.

               <p>
                  The implied infinity in this model is a concern which is elaborated by Jonathon Swift
                  in rhyme wherein the type in question is the type `flea':
                  
                  
                  <div class="quotation">

               <p> In fact, if we are to avoid asserting an infinity of parts of parts of parts then
                  we 
                  must specify <em>zero</em>, one or more parts within the whole as here:
                  
                  
                  <img src="./svg/typeRecursive2.svg" class="inline">
                  . Further, if we are to avoid asserting an infinity of ever bigger conglomerates as
                  suggested in Augustus De Morgan's rejoinder to Swift:
                  
                  <div class="quotation">
                     And the great fleas themselves, in turn, have greater fleas to go on,
                     
                     <div style="clear:left"></div>
                     While these again have greater still, and greater still, and so on
                     
                     <div style="clear:left"></div>
                     
                  </div>
                  
                  then we must specify that a part is <em>optionally</em> part of some other part as here:
                  
                  <img src="./svg/typeRecursive3.svg" class="inline">

                  then this is asserted by an arc drawn across the lines representing the composition
                  relationships as here:

               <p> This arc is called an exclusion relationship. 
                  Note that the presence of the arc circumvents the 
                  necessity to dash the relationship lines to represent optionality - optionality of
                  
                  relationships from parts to whole is implied.

                  figure 8 in which we have introduced a drive entity ( i.e a disk drive) to provide context
                  
                  for those folders which do not themselves have folders for context.

               <p>
                  The front and rear wheels of a bicycle are parts which play different roles within
                  the whole - arguably 
                  the front and back wheels should be modelled as different types of entity for the
                  rear wheel has a 
                  sprocket, or at least a housing for one, whilst the front does not. In the case of
                  a child's scooter though 
                  or in the case, prior to pedal power, of the velocipede, the whole thing has two identical
                  parts playing 
                  different roles within the whole. It is for reasons like this that the role played
                  by a part in a whole 
                  may be specified in a model. The role played is described as an annotation on the
                  composition relationship 
                  at the `whole' end of the relationship. 
                  
               </p> 
               
               
               <p> Sentence structure gives an example of this, it is shown in figure 9. 
                  There may be multiple noun phrases within a sentence - a simple sentence must have
                  a 
                  subject noun phrase 
                  and it may have have an object noun phrase. Like the front wheel and the rear wheel
                  
                  of a child's scooter 
                  the subject and object noun phrases are in and by themselves indistinguishable.

                  Similarly, the terms `true' and `false' are not relative terms - they do not rely
                  on context for their  interpretation - therefore they are absolutes and can be represented
                  in relationship to the absolute.  
                  We will follow the computer science convention of representing them as being of 
                  type `boolean' which in  common language might be translated as the made up word `truthliness'.
                  
                  This leads to the model shown in 
                  figure 14 which depicts true and false as absolutes and as entities of type `boolean'. 
                  Note that from this model we are able to infer the only boolean entities are either
                  the absolute `true' or  the absolute `false'.

               <p> We might not have said this already: an entity model defines the rules 
                  by which entities of any of its types may exist; they do so by declaring the context
                  
                  for their existence i.e. other types of entities and the relationships in which they
                  must 
                  be with these entities in order to exist. The uppermost model in figure 9 
                  declares then that every noun phrase is either subject or object of a sentence
                  \footnote{though 
                  the model states this please be aware that the model might be misguided! Also, later,
                  we 
                  shall we come back to many ambiguities with terms like `word', and likewise is true
                  for the 
                  terms `noun' and `noun phase'.}. Similarly, from the model in figure 14 we are able to 
                  infer that the only boolean entities are either the absolute `true' or the absolute
                  `false'.

               <br><h2>Use of Generalisations</h2>
               
               <p>
                  We gave the example in figure 1 of an atomic nucleus being composed of many protons and neutrons.
                  This can be expressed slightly differently using the generalisation `nucleon' of the
                  individual terms `proton' and `neutron'
                  by stating: an atomic nucleus is composed of one or more nucleons; every nucleon is
                  either a proton or a neutron;
                  (it's pretty much expressed this way in a diagram from the physicist Harald Fritzsch's
                  book - is it?). 
                  In an entity model diagram the generalisation type 
                  is shown as a box containing the specific types; so figure 1 may be expressed thus:
                  
                  
                  
                  <img src="./svg/nucleusNucleon.svg" class="inline">.
                  Be aware that there is a minor difference between this way of expressing the situation
                  and the form in figure 1: this way, 
                  is consistent with a nucleus with one neutron and zero protons - in physics this cannot
                  happen.
                  Equally neither representation expresses that the number of protons must equal the
                  number of electrons. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> The same generalisation can be used to express that protons and neutrons are combinations
                  of quarks:

                  figure 18, in which the model formally describes a certain

                  (an entity) `very fiercely' then qualifies the word `barking'.
                  The phrase `very fiercely' is an example of an `adverbial phrase' as represented in
                  the model in figure 18.

               <p>
                  When Gilbert Ryle introduced the phrase `category mistake' he gave a number of examples.
                  
                  The first example is of a visitor to Oxford. The visitor, upon viewing the colleges
                  and library, reportedly inquired "But where is the University?". 
                  The visitor's mistake, explains Ryle, is presuming that a University is 
                  part of the category ``units of physical infrastructure" or some such thing, 
                  rather than the category ``institutions", say, which are far more abstract and complex
                  
                  conglomerations of buildings, people, procedures, and so on.

               <br><h2>Linguistics: Modelling Sentence Structure</h2>
               \label{modellingSentenceStructure}
               
               
               <p> In this section we give an extended example of entity modelling by demonstrating
                  the modelling of English sentence structure. 
                  Our starting point has been the syntactic rules presented in chapters x-z of the book
                  of Brinton: <em>The Structure of Modern English</em>\footnote{Brinton, 2000}.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> In the study of syntax, linguists seek to understand and express the rules by which
                  some sequences of words can be comprehended as having a structure which is well-formed
                  - that is, we find them  grammatical - and some do not. In earlier sections we have
                  spoken about an entity model as representing a theory of what is; we illustrate this
                  now for, as Noam Chomsky wrote in 1957,
                  <em>a grammar of the language L is a theory of L</em>\footnote{Syntactic Structures, N. Chomsky, 1957 (page 49)}. 
                  Chomsky says that each grammar is simply a description of a certain set of utterances,
                  namely those that it generates and he illustrates
                  with reference to a part of chemical theory concerned with structurally possible compounds.
                  
                  Such a theory, says Chomsky, might be said to generate all physically possible compounds
                  just as a grammar generates all 
                  grammatically `possible' utterances\footnote{Syntactic Structures(page 48)}\footnote
                  {Since Chomsky's 1957 descriptions of 
                  phrase structure rules, transformation rules and morphophonemic rules there many different
                  approaches to expressing sentence structure. 
                  The models developed in this section cover the same ground as the phrase structure
                  rules of Chomsky which are expressed as a class of 
                  grammar know as a context free. All context free grammars lead naturally and mechanically
                  to entity models of parse trees. 
                  This section is an illustration of this.}.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> Different authors have described English by various grammatical systems and with
                  varying and over lapping degrees of 
                  success and agreement but each grammar do described is a rule system and what all
                  such rule systems do is to identify and 
                  classify relationships between different parts of grammatical sentences; linguists
                  bring to our attention types of entities 
                  and accompanying composition relationships which otherwise remain hidden. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> 
                  Rule systems invariably focus on different word classes i.e. different types of words
                  such as were introduced in section .
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p>  
                  The type of each word of an example sentence  can be shown by annotating the word
                  entities as follows:

               <p> With regard to the types of words - many words can be used say as nouns and as verbs
                  and so it is the \emph{use} of the word 
                  that is the entity to which a type is assigned.

               <p> Figure 21 shows the hierarchically structure of a simple sentence. 
                  It shows the composition relationships between its constituents parts. 
                  Each of the boxes in figure 21 is an example of a sentence constituent - a single word or a phrase; 
                  this is a key entity type for the linguist.

               <p> According to Brinton:
                  
                  <div class="quotation">
                     The study of syntax is the analysis of the constituent parts of a sentence: their
                     form, positioning,
                     and function. Constituents are the proper subparts of sentences. There are different
                     types of constituents classified by the categories which constitute them; these have
                     different
                     functions and internal structures with elements arranged in a specific way. And they
                     may
                     themselves be complex, containing other constituents. The structure of a sentence
                     is hence
                     hierarchical.
                     
                  </div>
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> Brinton notes that not all sequences of words function as constituents. 
                  It is the context, he says,  which determines whether a particular sequence 
                  forms a constituent or not. For example, the sequence of words <em>beautiful flowers</em>
                  is a constituent in <em>I received beautiful flowers for my birthday</em> but not in <em>Though they are beautiful, 
                     flowers cause me to sneeze</em>. The sequence <em>the house on the hill</em> is a constituent in one reading of the ambiguous 
                  sentence <em>I bought the house on the hill</em>, but not in the other; it is a constituent in the sense `I bought the house which
                  is on the hill', 
                  but not in the sense `I bought the house while standing on the hill'.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               
               <p> We can represent sentence constituent as an entity type generalising `phrase' and
                  `word': 
                  
               </p>

               <h3>Types of Phrase</h3>
               
               <p>
                  Our example sentence is of a type that is often termed a `simple' sentence and consists
                  of a subject followed by a predicate as shown in figure \ref {subjectpredicate}. 
                  Other examples of the same type, subject followed by predicate, are shown in table
                  ;
                  each subject in the table can equally combine with any of the given predicates to
                  form a well-formed sentence. 
                  Though ten sentences are presented by combining different subjects with different
                  predicates we can generate 100 different 
                  sentences\footnote{But only the proviso that some verbs need be inflected to match
                  their subjects - for example `We is for sale' 
                  needs become `We are for sale'.}. What we cannot do is pair any two subjects to produce
                  a well-formed sentence nor any two predicates. This illustrates 
                  that subject phrases and predicate phrases are of distinct types. These are the types
                  `noun phrase' and `verb phrase' respectively. These types of 
                  phrase can appear in other contexts within sentences but for now they appear as subject

                  sentence(S) may be constructed as a noun phrase(NP) followed by a verb phrase(VP).

                  What such a rule () does not do is to give a name to the role played by the noun
                  phrase (NP) in the sentence -- that of subject -- and nor does it give a name -- predicate
                  -- to the role played 
                  by the verb phrase (VP). In Entity Modelling we have a notation for just such matters
                  and accordingly we can represent 
                  the subject-predicate rule inclusive of role names by the entity model fragment shown
                  in figure 24.

                  shown in the 
                  subject and predicate columns of table . Linguists recognise these different phrase types and, 
                  just as for the different types of words, phrases may be substituted in sentences
                  by phrases of like type without 
                  effecting the acceptability of the sentence. Table  shows some of the major distinctions

                  composition relationships that are 
                  possible between the different phrase types of a sentence. In this way we use the
                  entity modelling notation as a meta-language in which we describe how different types
                  of sentence constituent can be combined 
                  into grammatical sentences and in so doing present a
                  description of a set of rules for sentence construction. There is not, in linguistic
                  theory, an unequivocal set of rules to 
                  follow  - the rules we choose to model follow close to those presented by Brinton.

               <p>
                  We have examples of verb phrases in the right hand column of table . 
                  They are quite varied in their structure. Here is a typical analysis of a verb phrase,
                  in this case for the 
                  predicate of figure 23:

                  Generally, a verb phrase contains a verb which is said to be the head of the phrase.
                  In this example the verb is 
                  complemented by a direct object which is of type `noun phrase'. Note that we can be
                  sure that the phrase `a new record' is of type `noun phrase' 
                  because we can construct a sentence with it as the subject. In fact it can replace
                  any of the subjects in table   
                  and new sentences result and, providing that verbs are conjugated appropriately, the
                  results are well-formed though admittedly they are in some 
                  cases very unusual.  
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> According to this analysis the phrase `set a new record' is a verb phrase constructed
                  as a `verb' followed by a `noun phrase' and 
                  this is one general rule of a number of such for the construction of verb phrases.
                  Formally expressed the rule is:
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <div class="displayfigure">
                     <div>
                        <div class="div">VP</div>
                        <div class="longrightarrow"></div>
                        <div class="div">V NP</div>
                     </div>
                  </div>
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> In an entity model we can represent this like this:
                  
                  
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  <div style="margin:auto; width:4.199999999999999cm"><img src="./svg/brintonTransitiveVerbPhrase.svg"></div>
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> In other cases a verb phase consists just of a verb alone and has no constituent
                  noun phrase. Only certain verbs that can be used in this way and these are said to
                  be intransitive. Thus `he cries' is an example in which `he' is the subject and `cries'
                  is a predicate verb phrase consisting solely of the verb.
                  Formally:
                  
               </p>
               
               
               
               
               <div class="displayfigure">
                  <div>
                     <div class="div">VP</div>
                     <div class="longrightarrow"></div>
                     <div class="div">V</div>
                  </div>
               </div>
               
               <p> The entity model equivalent is simply this:</p>
               
               
               <p> These fragments can be combined like this: </p>
               
               
               <div style="clear:left"></div>
               <div style="margin:auto; width:5.8999999999999995cm"><img src="./svg/brintonTransitiveAndIntransitiveCombined.svg"></div>
               <div style="clear:left"></div>
               
               
               <p>
                  Still other verb phrases have two obhjects a direct object of the action and an indirect
                  object. Formally: 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               
               <div class="displayfigure">
                  <div>
                     <div class="div">VP</div>
                     <div class="longrightarrow"></div>
                     <div class="div">V NP NP</div>
                  </div>
               </div>
               
               
               <p> This leads to a model combining representations of 
                  rules (), () and ()like this:
                  
                  
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  <div style="margin:auto; width:8.7cm"><img src="./svg/brintonTransitiveIntransitiveAndDiTransitiveCombined.svg"></div>
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  
                  
               </p>
               
               
               
               <p> It is worth saying at this point as an illustration of the choices that are open
                  to an entity modeller in any modelling situation that sometimes the two rules above
                  will be represented together
                  as a single combined rule in which parentheses are used to indicate optionality of
                  the noun phrase: 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               
               
               <div class="displayfigure">
                  <div>
                     <div class="div">VP</div>
                     <div class="longrightarrow"></div>
                     <div class="div">V (NP)</div>
                  </div>
               </div>
               
               
               <p> Likewise the entity modeller may dispense with the types representing the transitive
                  and intransitive cases and represent the combined situation like this:
                  
                  
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  <div style="margin:auto; width:4.5cm"><img src="./svg/brintonAlternateTransitiveRepresentation.svg"></div>
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> 
                  In total, Brinton describes seven different constructions for verb phrase. These constructions
                  are both summarised and illustrated in table . Alternatively the rules summarised in table  can be expressed by combining all the different rules into the entity model of a
                  verb phrase shown in figure  
                  25 in which types `noun phrase', and `prepositional phrase' are yet to be described
                  but `adjectival phrase' was described 
                  earlier in section xxx.

               <h3>The Grammar of the Noun Phrase</h3>
               
               <p> 
                  There are three main types of Noun Phrase and paradoxically two of these types consist
                  of 
                  phrases which are degenerate in the sense that they consist of single words - Pronouns
                  and Proper Names because words of 
                  these types are grammatically acceptable as the subjects of sentences. For simplicity
                  of the modelling we will henceforth 
                  consider pronouns and proper names as types of noun phrase. The other type of noun
                  phrase takes a number of forms but does 
                  actually contain a noun and for technical reasons is known as type `N-bar-bar'\footnote{It
                  may be abbreviated $\bar{\bar{N}}$}.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> By way of illustration for the model of N-bar-bar consider the phrase <em>The wildly yapping dog on the sofa</em>. 
                  We can annotate the types of word and constituent phrase are as follows:
                  
               </p>

               <p> In our earlier example the noun phrase which was the subject of our sentence is analysed
                  like this:

               <p> 
                  The final step in constructing a model of a simple sentence is achieved by putting
                  together the models represented in 
                  figures 24,25 and 26 and rearranging
                  the diagram to suit. The resulting model is shown in figure 27.

               <p> 
                  If we model the marriage entity then we make it double dependent on person entity
                  and 
                  since at the time of writing same sex marriage is not legal in my part of the world
                  I can 
                  model it as a dependent on a male entity on the one hand, and a female on the other:
                  
                  
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  <div style="margin:auto; width:2.6999999999999997cm"><img src="./svg/maleFemaleMarriage.svg"></div>
                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> In this model, unlike in those of figures 9 and 10 
                  to which it is superficially similar, the subordinate 
                  entity, `marriage', has no exclusion arc between its dependencies -- which is to say
                  that the model shows each subordinate entity `marriage' to be dependent on two superordinate
                  entities -   those shown as `male' and `female'. For the first time we see that the
                  modelling notation is not constrained to situations where every entity has at most
                  one other that it is dependent on. 
                  It is common practice to describe situations that do have this characteristic as <em>hierarchical</em> - it is the defining principle of
                  hierarchy that in a hierarchical system every entity within the system is subordinate
                  to at most one other entity. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> In other instances of matrix structure the branch types (by which I mean for example
                  the types <em>row</em> and <em>column</em> above) are not 
                  distinct types. We'll see this in the next example - the type in question being <em>arc</em>.  
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> Mathematicians define and use various notions each which abstract the idea of a network
                  of points and connecting lines independently of 
                  how or whether physically realised. 
                  They define such abstract notions using the language of sets and relations;
                  they use the term `graph' for the most abstract concept of such a network and they
                  variously use the terms `point', `node' or `vertex' for the 
                  things connected; generally they use the term `edge', `directed edge', `arc' or `arrow'
                  for the connections. 
                  There is not a single terminology and so we have to plump for one of several available;
                  our definitions will clarify the choices made. 
                  For an entity modeller, and therefore for a database designer, the most straight forward
                  of the graph notions is that of a `directed graph'.

               <h3>Simple Graphs and Identifying Relationships</h3>
               
               <p> One of the restrictions often places on graph structures is that there be at most
                  one edge between any two vertices. 
                  The term `simple graph' is used for graphs having this property and having the further
                  property that vertices are not 
                  linked to themselves. Now the fact that there is at most one edge between any two
                  verticies means that an edge can be uniquely
                  identified by identifying the vertices that it connects. 
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> The `arc' type as used in models of simple directed graphs is an example of one each
                  whose instances may be uniquely 
                  identified by relationships with other entities. Such relationships in entity modelling
                  terminology are said 
                  to be <em>identifying relationships</em> though this terminology lacks rigour for it is the set of them which 
                  are identifying not the individual relationships. 
                  
               </p>    
               
               
               <p> Identifying relationships are represented with a mark across the relationship having
                  the form of the letter `I'. 
                  Adding these marks to the model of a directed graph we get the model of a simple directed
                  graph:

                  <div style="clear:left"></div>
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p> The terms <em>network</em> and <em>matrix</em> are commonly used in contrast to the term hierarchical to refer to arrangements of
                  entities not 
                  constrained to be hierarchical; for example in organisational structure the term <em>matrix management</em> is used in
                  situations were different dimensions are managed by different management hierarchies
                  and in which individuals therefore have multiple reporting lines. 
                  The term hierarchical is etymologically derived from Greek <em>sacred ruler</em> and emerged in its modern sense via its use 
                  in medieval times in relation to the church organisation.

               <h3>Matrices and Tabular Displays</h3>
               
               
               <p> In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numeric elements, for example
                  \[ \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
                  
                  <tr>
                     
                     <td>23 </td>
                     <td> 15 </td>
                     <td> 29 </td>
                     
                  </tr>
                  
                  <tr>
                     
                     <td>31 </td>
                     <td> 6 </td>
                     <td> 9  </td>
                     
                  </tr>
                  
                  <tr>
                     
                     <td>-1 </td>

                     <td> 17  </td>
                     
                  </tr>
                  
                  \end{array} \right)\] 
                  
                  
                  <p> is a matrix having 3 rows and 3 columns. Though, as with all matrix structure, 
                     this is essentially 2 dimensional, the content can be communicated linearly either
                     row by row ([23,15,29], [31,6,9] and [-1,8,17]) 
                     or column by column ([23,31,-1],[15,6,8] and [29,9,17]). 
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p> As you see with this example, each element of any matrix is both part of a row and
                     part of a column and so, as with the `marriage' entity, the `element' entity is 
                     modelled as a subordinate to two others of different types as shown in figure 28. The two ways of communicating the matrix correspond to the two branches of this
                     entity model. The row by row communication is described by this model:

               <p> There is a similar shape to the models representing the structure\footnote{I am distinguishing
                  here between the structure of the
                  tabular display from the structure of the subject entitites} of a rectangular table
                  of data. An example is given in figure . 
                  In the HTML language, and in other computer markup languages, data tables are communicated
                  row by row rather than column by column.

               <p> In other tabular displays the rows or columns of a table, or both, may be grouped
                  together
                  to represent some grouping of the subjects. The structure then has different branches
                  that are hierarchical and joined at the detail level
                  into the recognisable shape of the 2 dimensional matrix structure. One such is illustrated
                  in figure .

               <p> Whereas, matrix structure, as considered in the previous section, is essentially
                  2 dimensional, hierarchically structured information may be 
                  flattened into a linear i.e. 1 dimensional structure 
                  in which nesting of detail represents the hierarchy. XML is a language designed for
                  this purpose.

               <p> In the XML language communication of a hierarchically structured entity, each type
                  \texttt{<em>X</em>} of entity is enclosed by its own parenthesis in the form
                  of character sequences
